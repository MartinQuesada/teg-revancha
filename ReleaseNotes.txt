			          v0.11.0                                       


ChangeLog:

 . This is GNOME 2 only version. GNOME 1 support was removed, so you need to
   have installed the GNOME 2 environment to try this version of TEG.
   
 . A metaserver is now integrated to TEG.

 . The theme 'm2' is the default theme of TEG.

 . The server kicks robots when the game is over and no humans are
   connected.

 . Translations were updated. Added new translation: Brazilian

 . Robots talks less frequently

 . GGZ Support for v0.0.6 was added.

 . gconf is used to save the preferences.
   If you have installed GNOME2 from binaries, probably you will want to
   configure TEG as follows:

    ./configure --enable-gconf-source=xml::/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults

   If you have installed GNOME2 from the sources you can ommit that line.
