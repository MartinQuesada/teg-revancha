## Installation ##
The simplest way to compile this package is:

* 1 `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure` to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using 'csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure` instead to prevent 'csh' from trying to execute
     'configure' itself.

     Running 'configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

* 2 Type `make` to compile the package.

* 3 Optionally, type `make check` to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

* 4 Type `make install` to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.
